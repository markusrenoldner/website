Welcome to my homepage. Here you can find information about 

- my research and my publications,
- notes on mathematical and scientific topics that are both useful and about which I did not manage to find satisfactory information myself,
- my CV, i.e. my educational background and my professional experience.

My research field is numerical analysis, in particular theory and applications of Finite Element methods. My current focus is on constructing discretization methods for equations from fusion plasma physics.

Feel free to reach out via email or Linkedin (see on the left).
